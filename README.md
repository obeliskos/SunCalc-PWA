# SunCalc-PWA

## A Progressive Web App for calculating current daylight hours relative to solstices

## Overview

Currently, this app is an adaptation of an older html page which i created a few years ago.
It is based on Vladimir Agafonkin's suncalc.js library found at  https://github.com/mourner/suncalc.
I am currently using an older version of Chart.js https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js.

I will try to update the manifest and cache url locations to work with url addressing such as rawgit so that it can be installed directly from this web page.

## Installing

If you want to install this SunCalc PWA app, served up from my GitHub Pages, [click this link](https://obeliskos.github.io/suncalc/index.html) in Chrome and you should be able to "Install" the app from the Chrome menu.  This "Install" menu may only appear after having spent 30 seconds on the site.

## Roadmap

I don't anticipate making too many changes to this repo, however I may perform minor cleanup and persisting of location data in local storage.
